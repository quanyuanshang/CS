\item \defpoints{15} [Convolutional Neural Networks]

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consider a sequential 2D convolution block consist of 10 layers. Suppose the input dimension is 4 $\times$ 64 $\times$ 64 (channel, width, height) and we use \textbf{two} continously Conv2D layer. The first layer is with 4 channels input and 8 channels output, where the kernel size is 3 $\times$ 3 (width, height). And the second layer is with 8 channels input and 16 channels output, where the kernel size is 5 $\times$ 5 (width, height). Set both the layers with stride = 1 and pad = 1. What is the output dimension after each layer? How many parameters do we have in these two layers in total? \defpoints{10} [Hint: Do not forget the bias term.]
    \item The convolution layer is followed by a max pooling layer with $2\times 2$ (width, height) filter and stride
    = 2. What is the output dimension of the pooling layer? How many parameters do we have in the pooling
    layer? \defpoints{5}
\end{enumerate}
