\item \defpoints{15} [Convolution and Cross-Correlation]

(a) Compute cross-correlation and convolution of $A$ and $B$ (Use $B$ as the filter), respectively. Both the operations are with zero-padding, $P=1$, and stride is set to be 1. \defpoints{12}

$$
A=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
2 & 4 & -3 \\
3 & -2 & 2 \\
-3 & 1 & 4
\end{array}\right], \quad B=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
3 & 1 & -2 \\
-2 & 2 & 4 \\
1 & 3 & -3
\end{array}\right]
$$

(b) Under what circumstances does convolution have the same result as correlation? \defpoints{3}

[Hint: Please notice the mathmatical definition of convolution and cross-correlation.]
