\item \defpoints{10} [Equivalence of PCA objectives]

Consider a dataset of $n$ observations $\mathbf{X}\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$, and our goal is to project the data onto a subspace having dimensionality $p$, $p<d$. Prove that PCA based on projected variance maximization is equivalent to PCA based on projected error (Euclidean error) minimization.
