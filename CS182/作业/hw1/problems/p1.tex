\item \defpoints{15} [Math review(Linear Algebra)] Rank properties. Suppose a matrix $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$, prove:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] $\rank(A)\leq \min(m, n)$ ~\defpoints{4} (Hint: You just need to consider the foundamental transformation of the matrix. And how $\rank$ is defined.)
    \item[(b)] $\rank(AB)\leq \min(\rank(A),\rank(B))$. ~\defpoints{4}
    \item[(c)] $\rank(A^{\top}A)=\rank(A)$. ~\defpoints{4} (Hint: consider the identity between $\rank$ and $\nullity$)
    \item[(d)] What does the rank of a matrix essentially refer to? (Hint: consider the correspondence to the singularvalues.) ~\defpoints{3}
\end{itemize}
