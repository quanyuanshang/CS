\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] Suppose $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a second order differentiable function. Write down the second order Taylor expansion of $f(x)$ around $x_0$ with Peano's form of the remainder. ~\defpoints{3}
    \item[(b)] Suppose $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a second order differentiable function. Write down the first order and second order's mean value theorem for $f(x)$ related to point $x$ and $x+d$. ~\defpoints{4}
    \item[(c)] Suppose $f: \mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a second order differentiable function. Write down the second order Taylor expansion of $f(\mathbf{x})$ around $\mathbf{x}_0$ with Peano's form of the remainder. ~\defpoints{4} (Hint: the first order derivative is the gradient $\nabla f$, the second order derivative is the Hessian $\nabla^2 f$.)
    \item[(d)] Suppose $f: \mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a second order differentiable function. Write down the first order and second order's mean value theorem for $f(\mathbf{x})$ related to point $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{d}$. ~\defpoints{4}
